# Sponsor
**OpenSourceTest is maintained by a team of volunteers from all around the world in their free time. While we work on OpenSourceTest because we love the project and use it daily at our daily jobs, monetary compensation when possible is welcome to justify time away from friends, family and personal time.**

**Money is also used to fund local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example) and every few years a large sprint involving all members.**

**Thank you for your sponsorship of the OpenSourceTest program**
